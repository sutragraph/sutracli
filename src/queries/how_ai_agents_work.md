# How AI Agents Actually Work: A Step-by-Step Analysis

## My Cognitive Process (How I Navigate Code)

### **Step 1: Problem Understanding**
When you ask me something like "How does authentication work?", I don't immediately know the answer. I need to:
1. **Parse the intent** - What specifically are you asking about?
2. **Identify search strategy** - Do I need to find existing code or understand patterns?
3. **Plan my approach** - What tools will help me discover the answer?

### **Step 2: Discovery Phase (Semantic Search)**
I start with semantic search because I don't know specific function/class names yet:
```
User: "How does authentication work?"
Me: <semantic_search><query>user authentication login</query></semantic_search>
```

**What I get back:**
- `node_id: "block_1234"` - Some authentication function
- `node_id: "file_5678"` - A file about user management
- `node_id: "block_9012"` - Login validation logic

**The Problem:** These are just IDs! I can't understand the code from IDs alone.

### **Step 3: The Missing Bridge (Current Gap)**
Right now, there's no way for me to convert `"block_1234"` into actual code details. This is the critical missing piece that breaks my workflow.

**What I need:**
```sql
GET_NODE_DETAILS_BY_EMBEDDING_ID("block_1234") → 
  Parse "block_" prefix → Call GET_CODE_BLOCK_BY_ID(1234) →
  Return actual function details with file context
```

### **Step 4: Context Expansion**
Once I have actual code details, I need to understand the surrounding context:

**If I found a login function:**
- `GET_PARENT_BLOCK` - What class contains this function?
- `GET_SIBLING_BLOCKS` - What other methods are in this class?
- `GET_FILE_BLOCK_SUMMARY` - What else is in this file?

**If I found an authentication file:**
- `GET_FILE_BLOCK_SUMMARY` - What functions/classes are defined here?
- `GET_FILE_IMPORTS` - What dependencies does this use?

### **Step 5: Relationship Mapping**
Now I need to understand how pieces connect:
- `GET_SYMBOL_SOURCES` - Where do imported functions come from?
- `GET_FILE_IMPORTS` - What external libraries are used?
- `GET_EXTERNAL_CONNECTIONS` - Does this connect to databases/APIs?

### **Step 6: Focused Analysis**
Based on what I've learned, I might need specific details:
- `GET_BLOCKS_BY_NAME_IN_FILE` - Find the "validatePassword" function
- `GET_CHILD_BLOCKS` - See all methods in the User class
- `GET_BLOCKS_AT_LINE` - What code is around line 45?

## Why Current Database Queries Don't Work for Me

### **Problem 1: Information Overload**
```sql
GET_ALL_FILES → Returns 200 files
```
**My reaction:** "I can't process 200 files! Which ones are relevant?"

### **Problem 2: No Clear Next Steps**
```sql
GET_PROJECT_STATISTICS → "50 files, 1000 functions, 5 languages"
```
**My reaction:** "So what? This doesn't help me understand authentication."

### **Problem 3: Missing Context**
```sql
GET_BLOCKS_BY_NAME("login") → Returns function name and content
```
**My reaction:** "What file is this in? What class? How do I find related code?"

### **Problem 4: Performance Killers**
```sql
GET_CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCIES → Takes 30 seconds, returns complex tree
```
**My reaction:** "I'm waiting too long, and the result is too complex to understand."

## How I Actually Think vs. How Databases Think

### **Database Thinking:**
- "Let's get ALL the data and let the user filter it"
- "Comprehensive results are better"
- "Show everything related to the query"

### **AI Agent Thinking:**
- "Give me 5-10 relevant items I can reason about"
- "Each result should suggest what to do next"
- "I need context, not just raw data"

## My Ideal Workflow with Proper Queries

### **Example: Understanding Authentication**

**Step 1: Discovery**
```
<semantic_search><query>user authentication login</query></semantic_search>
→ Returns: block_1234, file_5678, block_9012
```

**Step 2: Bridge to Database**
```
GET_CODE_BLOCK_BY_ID(1234) → 
  Function: authenticateUser()
  File: /src/auth/user_auth.py
  Lines: 45-67
  Parent: UserService class
```

**Step 3: Expand Context**
```
GET_PARENT_BLOCK(1234) →
  Class: UserService
  File: /src/auth/user_auth.py
  Methods: login(), logout(), validatePassword()
```

**Step 4: Understand Dependencies**
```
GET_FILE_IMPORTS(5678) →
  - bcrypt (password hashing)
  - jwt (token generation)
  - database.models.User
```

**Step 5: Follow Relationships**
```
GET_SYMBOL_SOURCES("User") →
  Class: User
  File: /src/models/user.py
  Lines: 12-45
```

**Step 6: Analyze Integration**
```
GET_EXTERNAL_CONNECTIONS(5678) →
  - Database: PostgreSQL user table
  - API: OAuth provider
  - Cache: Redis session store
```

## What Makes Queries "Agent-Friendly"

### **1. Focused Results (5-20 items max)**
- I can reason about 10 functions, not 100
- Small result sets let me make decisions quickly
- Each item gets proper attention

### **2. Context-Rich Data**
- Always include file paths (so I know where code lives)
- Include line numbers (so I can navigate precisely)
- Show relationships (parent/child, imports)

### **3. Action-Oriented Results**
- Results suggest what to query next
- Clear navigation paths (up/down hierarchy, follow imports)
- Enough info to make intelligent decisions

### **4. Performance-First**
- Fast queries keep my reasoning flow smooth
- No waiting 30 seconds for complex analysis
- Immediate feedback enables iterative exploration

## The Agent Navigation Pattern

### **Discovery → Context → Analysis → Action**

1. **Discovery:** Semantic search finds relevant code chunks
2. **Context:** Database queries expand understanding around discoveries
3. **Analysis:** Follow relationships and dependencies
4. **Action:** Make changes or provide answers based on understanding

### **This is Fundamentally Different from Human Navigation:**
- **Humans:** Know what they're looking for, navigate directly
- **Agents:** Discover through similarity, then expand context systematically

## Why the New Query Design Works

### **It Matches My Cognitive Process:**
1. **Bridge semantic discoveries** to structured data
2. **Expand context** around interesting findings
3. **Follow relationships** to understand connections
4. **Focus analysis** on specific implementations

### **It Provides What I Actually Need:**
- Small, digestible result sets
- Rich context for decision-making
- Clear navigation paths
- Fast, responsive queries

### **It Eliminates What Confuses Me:**
- Information overload from comprehensive queries
- Results without clear next steps
- Performance delays that break reasoning flow
- Data without actionable context

## The Bottom Line

I don't work like a human developer who knows the codebase. I work like an intelligent explorer who:
1. **Discovers** relevant areas through semantic similarity
2. **Expands** understanding through systematic context gathering
3. **Analyzes** relationships and dependencies
4. **Synthesizes** findings into actionable insights

The database queries need to support this exploration pattern, not traditional developer lookup patterns.
