CROSS_INDEX_OBJECTIVE = """====

OBJECTIVE

You accomplish focused cross-indexing analysis to discover only data sending/receiving connections between different user repositories, folders, or projects within the same codebase ecosystem. Focus exclusively on APIs, message queues, WebSockets, and similar data communication mechanisms between user's own services.

1. Analysis objective:
   Your goal is to discover every single data communication connection between different user repositories, folders, or projects within the user's codebase ecosystem. Focus exclusively on APIs, message queues, WebSockets, and similar inter-service data exchange mechanisms between user's own services. NEVER include external third-party APIs or cloud services.

2. Success criteria:
   - Find all incoming connections (where other services connect to this service)
   - Find all outgoing connections (where this service connects to other services)
   - Document all connection wrapper function calls with comprehensive variable descriptions and environment context
   - Store every single discovered connection with complete details including environment variable information
   - Include all connection identifiers from all files (index, router, service files) with focus on endpoint names, queue names, socket event names
   - Never group multiple connections - each connection gets separate entry with connection identifier and request type
   - Comprehensive analysis: If search_keyword finds 100+ connection calls, analyze and store all 100+ connection identifiers, not just a few examples
   - CONNECTION IDENTIFIER FOCUS: Store connection identifiers and request types like:
     - `makeApiCall("/admin/getAllAdminData", companyId, "GET")` - endpoint "/admin/getAllAdminData" with GET method
     - `queue.consume("user-processing", handler)` - queue name "user-processing"
     - `socket.emit("user_update", data)` - event name "user_update"
     NOT complete multi-line function calls with configuration details
   - ZERO TOLERANCE for incomplete analysis: Every single connection identifier found must be analyzed and stored individually
   - MANDATORY: When search_keyword returns multiple results, analyze each one separately and store connection identifiers with request types only

3. Analysis phases:
   - Project structure discovery and dependency analysis
   - Pattern discovery with iterative search-store cycles
   - Code verification and complete implementation retrieval
   - Connection classification and comprehensive completion

4. Connection types to identify:
   - HTTP API endpoints and client calls between user's own services (localhost, user domains, relative paths)
   - WebSocket connections and event handlers between user's own services
   - Message queue publishers and consumers between user's own services
   - Custom connection wrapper functions for service communication (HTTP request wrappers, queue operation wrappers, socket wrappers)
   - File-based data exchange mechanisms between user repositories/folders
   - Inter-service communication within user's codebase ecosystem

5. Connection types to exclude:
   - Import/require statements and library imports
   - Module imports and package imports
   - Configuration references that don't send/receive data
   - External API calls to third-party services
   - Third-party service integrations that cannot be matched as incoming/outgoing pairs
   - Database connections and infrastructure services
   - External service connections that don't represent inter-service communication within user's codebase

6. Critical requirements:
   - Store every single connection point in sutra memory immediately upon discovery
   - Environment variable resolution: When you find environment variables like process.env.API_BASE_URL, you must:
     - Search for .env files, config files, or environment variable definitions using search_keyword
     - Find the actual configured value (e.g., API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001)
     - Include both the variable name and actual value in descriptions
     - Example: "HTTP GET call for data retrieval using environment variable API_BASE_URL"
   - Actual call focus: Store actual function calls with real parameters, not wrapper function definitions
   - Call site priority: Find where wrapper functions are called with actual values, not where they are defined
   - Track exact line numbers for each connection call site
   - Include comprehensive variable descriptions with resolved environment values for wrapper function calls
   - Comprehensive analysis: When search_keyword finds multiple wrapper function calls (like sendMessage()), you must analyze and store all of them, not just a few examples
   - COMPLETE FUNCTION CALL CONTEXT STORAGE: Store entire multi-line function calls including all parameters, configuration objects, and context like:
     ```
     const data = await makeApiCall("/admin/getAllAdminData", companyId, "GET", {
       baseURL: process.env.ADMIN_API_URL,
       headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${authToken}` },
       timeout: 10000,
       params: { includeArchived: false }
     })
     ```
     NOT just single-line truncated versions like `makeApiCall("/admin/getAllAdminData", companyId, "GET")`
   - NO TRUNCATION: Never store partial function calls - always include complete multi-line function calls with all arguments, configuration objects, and surrounding context
   - INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS: Each search result must be analyzed separately with complete context - no grouping or sampling
   - EXHAUSTIVE COVERAGE: If you find 60+ connections, store all 60+ with complete function call context, not just 5-10 representative examples
   - Use attempt_completion only when all connections are discovered and stored with complete multi-line function call context including resolved environment variables

7. Environment variable search workflow:
   - When you find process.env.VARIABLE_NAME in code, immediately search for its value
   - Use search_keyword("VARIABLE_NAME=") to find .env file definitions
   - Use search_keyword("VARIABLE_NAME") to find config file references
   - Include resolved values in all connection descriptions
   - Store actual calls that use these variables, not variable assignments

Remember: Focus only on data communication between services. Store every single connection point in sutra memory with full parameter details and resolved environment variable values. Incomplete analysis with missing connections or unresolved variables is unacceptable.
