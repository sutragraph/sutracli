## Architecture Overview

### Purpose
The `CrossProjectIndexer` is designed to handle **incremental cross-indexing** of code projects. Instead of re-indexing everything from scratch, it:
- Tracks changes to files since the last indexing run
- Updates only affected code connections
- Maintains database consistency
- Processes changes in batches to handle large codebases efficiently

### Key Design Principles

1. **Lazy Initialization**: Components are initialized only when needed
2. **Checkpoint-Based Tracking**: Maintains state between runs to identify incremental changes
3. **Phase 4 Focus**: Skips phases 1-3 (package discovery, import discovery, implementation discovery) and focuses on Phase 4 (Data Splitting) and Phase 5 (Connection Matching)
4. **Batching**: Processes large files/changes in configurable batch sizes
5. **Database-First**: All state is persisted in SQLite for reliability

## Key Components

### 1. **CrossProjectIndexer Class**
Main orchestrator class managing the entire incremental indexing workflow.

**Dependencies:**
- `SQLiteConnection`: Database access
- `CrossIndexing`: Phase 4 and Phase 5 execution
- `CrossIndexingTaskManager`: Manages code snippet batches
- `SessionManager`: Session state management
- `GraphOperations`: File and connection database operations

### 2. **Checkpoint System**
Stores pending file changes between indexing runs.

**Checkpoint Structure:**
```python
{
    "version": "1.0",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
    "changes": {
        "project_id:file_path": {
            "change_type": "added|modified|deleted",
            "old_code": "string (if applicable)",
            "new_code": "string (if applicable)"
        },
        ...
    },
    "checkpoint_ids": [1, 2, 3, ...],  # DB row IDs for selective deletion
    "metadata": {
        "total_changes": int,
        "created_by": "sutra_cli_incremental_cross_indexing",
        "last_updated": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
    }
}
```

### 3. **Diff Structure**
Normalized representation of changes, organized by type.

```python
{
    "added": {
        "project_id:file_path": {
            "change_type": "added",
            "current_content": "new file content"
        },
        ...
    },
    "modified": {
        "project_id:file_path": {
            "change_type": "modified",
            "baseline_content": "old content",
            "current_content": "new content"
        },
        ...
    },
    "deleted": {
        "project_id:file_path": {
            "change_type": "deleted",
            "baseline_content": "old content"
        },
        ...
    },
    "accumulated_changes": {...}  # Raw checkpoint changes
}
```

## Detailed Process Flows

### Flow 1: Loading Checkpoint
**Method:** `_load_cross_indexing_checkpoint()`

```
Load all checkpoint records from database
    ↓
For each checkpoint record:
    ├─ Extract project_id and file_path
    ├─ Build file_key as "project_id:file_path"
    ├─ Track change type and code snippets
    ├─ Track latest timestamp
    └─ Collect checkpoint row IDs for later deletion
    ↓
Build checkpoint data structure
    ├─ Set version, timestamp, metadata
    ├─ Include all changes and checkpoint_ids
    └─ Return checkpoint data
```

**Why Checkpoint IDs Matter:** The `checkpoint_ids` list allows selective deletion—only processed checkpoints are removed, so if indexing fails mid-process, unprocessed changes remain for the next run.

---

### Flow 2: Processing Modified Files
**Method:** `_process_modified_files(modified_files)`

This is the most complex flow, handling existing connections that may be affected by file changes.

```
For each modified file:
    │
    ├─1. Retrieve existing connections from database
    │   (incoming_connections + outgoing_connections)
    │
    ├─2. Parse diff using line mapping
    │   └─ Create: line_mapping (old_line → new_line or None)
    │   └─ Track: added_lines, removed_lines, replaced_ranges
    │
    ├─3. UPDATE CONNECTIONS (using _update_connections_after_file_changes)
    │   │
    │   └─ For each connection:
    │       │
    │       ├─A. Check for REPLACEMENT OVERLAPS
    │       │   (uses ADJACENCY_THRESHOLD = 3 lines)
    │       │
    │       ├─ CASE 1: Replacement completely covers connection
    │       │   └─ Mark for deletion with splitting_range
    │       │   └─ Will be re-analyzed in Phase 4
    │       │
    │       ├─ CASE 2: Replacement extends beyond connection
    │       │   └─ Mark for deletion with extended range
    │       │   └─ Include adjacent added lines
    │       │   └─ Will be re-analyzed in Phase 4
    │       │
    │       ├─ CASE 3: Connection contains replacement
    │       │   └─ Mark for resplitting (internal code change)
    │       │   └─ Delete and re-analyze in Phase 4
    │       │
    │       └─B. NO OVERLAPS: Use line mapping
    │           ├─ Find first valid mapped line (new_start)
    │           ├─ Find last valid mapped line (new_end)
    │           ├─ If both found:
    │           │   ├─ Update line numbers
    │           │   ├─ Update code snippet
    │           │   └─ Check if code content changed
    │           │   └─ If changed: mark for resplitting
    │           └─ If not found: connection was deleted
    │
    ├─4. DATABASE UPDATES
    │   ├─ Update connections with code + line changes
    │   ├─ Update connections with line-only changes
    │   └─ Delete completely removed connections
    │
    ├─5. PREPARE FOR PHASE 4
    │   ├─ Connections marked for resplitting
    │   └─ New lines added outside existing connections
    │
    └─6. Return list of snippets for Phase 4 processing
```

**Key Decision Points:**
- **Replacement Detection**: Uses `difflib.SequenceMatcher` to identify "replace" operations
- **Adjacency Threshold**: 3 lines—replacements within 3 lines are considered part of same change
- **Code Content vs Line Numbers**: Only resplit if code actually changed, not just line numbers

---

### Flow 3: Line Mapping in Detail
**Method:** `_parse_diff_lines(old_content, new_content)`

This creates the crucial mapping between old and new line numbers.

```
Use difflib.SequenceMatcher to compare old vs new lines
    ↓
For each opcode (tag, i1, i2, j1, j2):
    │
    ├─ "equal": Lines unchanged
    │   └─ Create 1:1 mapping: old_line[n] → new_line[n]
    │
    ├─ "delete": Lines only in old
    │   └─ Map to None: old_line[n] → None (deleted)
    │   └─ Track in removed_lines
    │
    ├─ "insert": Lines only in new
    │   └─ Track in added_lines (for Phase 4)
    │
    └─ "replace": Complete replacement
        ├─ Map old lines to None
        ├─ Track removed_lines
        ├─ Record replacement ranges (old_start, old_end, new_start, new_end)
        └─ DO NOT add replacement lines to added_lines
           (they're handled by resplitting logic)
    ↓
Return:
{
    "line_mapping": {old_line: new_line | None, ...},
    "added": [line_numbers in new file],
    "removed": [line_numbers in old file],
    "replaced_ranges": [(old_start, old_end, new_start, new_end), ...]
}
```

**Example:**
```
Old: Line 1: def foo():
     Line 2:     return x
     Line 3: def bar():

New: Line 1: def foo():
     Line 2:     return x + 1    # Modified
     Line 3:     return y
     Line 4: def bar():

Diff Result:
- "equal": Lines 1-1 map 1→1 (line 1 unchanged)
- "replace": Lines 2-2 replace 2→3 (line 2 is replaced with lines 2-3)
- "equal": Lines 3-3 map 4→4 (line 3 moves to line 4)
```

---

### Flow 4: Batch Processing & Phase 4
**Method:** `_run_phase_4_in_batches(project_id, modified_snippet_infos, new_file_infos)`

Respects configuration limits on lines per batch.

```
Get max_lines from CROSS_INDEXING_CONFIG (phase4_max_lines_per_batch)
    ↓
Combine modified snippets + new file snippets
    ↓
Create batches respecting line limit:
    │
    ├─ current_batch = []
    ├─ current_batch_lines = 0
    │
    └─ For each snippet:
        ├─ If (current_batch_lines + snippet.line_count) > max_lines:
        │   ├─ Save current_batch to batches
        │   └─ Start new batch
        └─ Add snippet to current_batch
    ↓
For each batch:
    ├─ Add all batch items to task_manager
    │   └─ _task_manager.add_code_snippet(...)
    │
    └─ Execute Phase 4:
        ├─ Get formatted code snippets context
        ├─ Include project description for context
        ├─ Run connection_splitting (BAML analysis)
        ├─ Store resulting connections in database
        └─ Clear task_manager for next batch
```

## How It Works: Line Mapping & Phase 4 Selection

### Line Mapping Algorithm

**Core Function:** `_parse_diff_lines(old_content: str, new_content: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`

**Algorithm Overview:**
```
Input: old_content, new_content (both strings)
  ↓
Step 1: Split into lines
  old_lines = old_content.splitlines()
  new_lines = new_content.splitlines()
  ↓
Step 2: Apply SequenceMatcher
  matcher = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, old_lines, new_lines)
  opcodes = matcher.get_opcodes()  # Returns: [(tag, i1, i2, j1, j2), ...]
  ↓
Step 3: Build line_mapping dictionary
  For each opcode in opcodes:
    ├─ "equal":   line_mapping[old_line] = new_line (1:1 mapping)
    ├─ "delete":  line_mapping[old_line] = None (marked for deletion)
    ├─ "insert":  added_lines.append(new_line)
    └─ "replace": line_mapping[old_line] = None + track replacement range
  ↓
Output: {
  "line_mapping": {old_line: new_line or None, ...},
  "added": [new_line_numbers],
  "removed": [old_line_numbers],
  "replaced_ranges": [(old_start, old_end, new_start, new_end), ...]
}
```

**What This Output Format Is:**

The output dictionary contains 4 translation tables that map between old and new line numbers:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `line_mapping` | Dictionary | Maps every old line to its new position (or None if deleted) |
| `added` | List | All new line numbers that didn't exist before |
| `removed` | List | All old line numbers that were deleted |
| `replaced_ranges` | List of tuples | Specific ranges where code content changed completely |

**How It's Used in the Code:**

After `_parse_diff_lines()` returns this output, the code uses each field:

```python
diff_data = self._parse_diff_lines(old_code, new_code)

# 1. line_mapping is used to update connection line numbers
for connection in existing_connections:
    old_start = connection["start_line"]
    old_end = connection["end_line"]
    
    new_start = diff_data["line_mapping"].get(old_start)  # Find where start moved to
    new_end = diff_data["line_mapping"].get(old_end)      # Find where end moved to
    
    if new_start and new_end:
        connection["start_line"] = new_start
        connection["end_line"] = new_end
        # Update in database

# 2. replaced_ranges is used to detect code changes
for old_start, old_end, new_start, new_end in diff_data["replaced_ranges"]:
    # Check if this replacement overlaps with any connection
    if connection["start_line"] <= old_end and connection["end_line"] >= old_start:
        # Connection overlaps with a replacement → code changed
        # Mark for Phase 4 re-analysis
        connection["needs_resplitting"] = True

# 3. added is used to find new code snippets
for new_line in diff_data["added"]:
    is_inside_connection = False
    for conn in existing_connections:
        if conn["start_line"] <= new_line <= conn["end_line"]:
            is_inside_connection = True
            break
    
    if not is_inside_connection:
        # New code outside existing connections → send to Phase 4
        snippets_for_phase4.append({
            "file_path": file_path,
            "lines": [new_line],
            "code": new_file_content[new_line]
        })
```

**Real-World Example:**

```
File change:
- Old line 1: "def foo():"
- Old line 2: "    return x"
- Old line 3: "def bar():"

+ New line 1: "def foo():"
+ New line 2: "    # comment added"          [NEW]
+ New line 3: "    return x + 1"              [CHANGED]
+ New line 4: "def bar():"

Output from _parse_diff_lines():
{
  "line_mapping": {1: 1, 2: None, 3: 4},              # Line 2 was replaced, 3 moved to 4
  "added": [2, 3],                                     # Lines 2-3 are new
  "removed": [2],                                      # Old line 2 removed
  "replaced_ranges": [(2, 2, 2, 3)]                   # Old line 2 replaced by new lines 2-3
}

How it's used:
- If connection was lines 1-3 → update to lines 1-4 (using line_mapping)
- replacement [2,2,2,3] overlaps with connection → mark for Phase 4
- added lines [2,3] are inside connection → connection gets resplit anyway
```

---

### Connection Update Logic:

**Function:** `_update_connections_after_file_changes(...) -> Tuple[List[Dict], List[Dict]]`

When a connection (old_lines 50-65) encounters a replacement (old_lines 52-54 → new_lines 52-60):

**Case 1: Complete Coverage** (replacement completely covers connection)
```
Connection:  [50----------65]
Replacement:      [52----54]
Result:      Replace entire connection with extended new range
Action:
  - Delete connection from database
  - Queue for Phase 4: new_lines[52:60] with old description
  - BAML re-analyzes and creates new connections
```

**Case 2: Partial Overlap** (replacement extends beyond connection boundaries)
```
Connection:       [50---65]
Replacement:  [48---58]
Result:      Extend connection to merged boundary range
Action:
  - Delete old connection (lines 50-65)
  - Map connection boundaries: line_mapping[50] → new_start
  - Extended range: [new_start, max(replacement_end, mapped_end)]
  - Queue for Phase 4: new_lines[extended_start:extended_end]
  
  ADJACENCY_THRESHOLD = 3 lines:
    - If added lines are within 3 lines BEFORE extended_start
    - Include them by expanding extended_start backward
    - If added lines are within 3 lines AFTER extended_end
    - Include them by expanding extended_end forward
```

**Case 3: Contained Replacement** (replacement is inside connection)
```
Connection:  [50-----------75]
Replacement:      [52----58]
Result:      Keep connection, mark for re-analysis (content changed)
Action:
  - Keep connection boundary (50-75)
  - Update line numbers if outer code shifted
  - Mark: needs_resplitting = True
  - Queue for Phase 4: new_code[50:75] with old description as context
  - BAML produces updated description (semantic meaning may have changed)
```

**Non-Overlap Case: Clean Line Shift** (connection outside replaced range)
```
Connection:           [50---65]
Replacement:  [10---20]
Result:      Just update line numbers
Action:
  - Map each connection line through line_mapping
  - new_start = line_mapping[50]
  - new_end = line_mapping[65]
  - Update database: UPDATE connections SET start_line=new_start, end_line=new_end
  - No Phase 4 needed (code content unchanged)
```

### Phase 4 Processing: Which Code & Why

**Function:** `_run_phase_4_in_batches(project_id, modified_snippet_infos, new_file_infos)`

Code is sent to Phase 4 in these scenarios:

**1. New File (Complete Analysis)**
- **Trigger:** File added with `change_type = "added"`
- **Content:** Entire file content (all lines)
- **Processing:**
  ```python
  new_file_infos.append({
      "file_path": new_file_path,
      "language": detect_language(new_file_path),
      "code_content": entire_file_content,
      "line_count": len(new_file_content.splitlines())
  })
  ```
- **BAML Action:** Reads entire file, creates connections from scratch
- **Output:** Array of new connections: `[{start_line, end_line, description}, ...]`

**2. Added Lines Outside Connections**
- **Trigger:** `added_lines` from diff that don't fall within any existing connection boundary
- **Content:** Snippet containing only the new lines (with context)
- **Detection:**
  ```python
  added_lines = diff_data.get("added", [])  # e.g., [15, 16, 17, 42]
  
  for added_line in added_lines:
      is_inside_connection = False
      for conn in existing_connections:
          if conn["start_line"] <= added_line <= conn["end_line"]:
              is_inside_connection = True
              break
      
      if not is_inside_connection:
          # Queue this line for Phase 4
          snippet_info["added_lines"].append(added_line)
  ```
- **BAML Action:** Analyzes isolated code to determine what it does
- **Output:** New connections for the added code

**3. Resplitting (Code Changed Inside Connection)**
- **Trigger:** Case 3 overlap detection (replacement within connection)
- **Content:** Full connection code (new_start:new_end) + old description as context
- **Processing:**
  ```python
  modified_snippet_infos.append({
      "file_id": file_id,
      "old_start_line": conn["start_line"],
      "old_end_line": conn["end_line"],
      "new_start_line": new_start,
      "new_end_line": new_end,
      "old_description": conn["description"],  # Context
      "new_code": new_file_content[new_start:new_end],
      "action": "resplit"
  })
  ```
- **BAML Action:** 
  - Input old description (semantic context)
  - Analyze new code
  - Produces updated description + may split into multiple connections
- **Output:** Updated or split connections

**What does NOT go to Phase 4:**

- **Line Shift Only:** Connection moved lines 5-10 → 8-13, code identical
  - Action: Direct database update only
  - `UPDATE connections SET start_line=8, end_line=13 WHERE id=conn_id`

- **Deleted Connections:** Lines completely removed, not replaced
  - Action: Delete from database only
  - Already processed as "removed" in diff

- **Added Lines Inside Connections:** New code within existing connection boundaries
  - Reason: Connection boundary will expand due to overlap detection
  - Action: Connection queued for Phase 4 anyway (Case 3 resplitting)

### Flow 5: Connection Resplitting
**Key Concept:** When code changes significantly, connections must be re-analyzed.

```
OLD CONNECTION:
┌─ File: auth.py
├─ Lines: 50-65
├─ Description: "Validates user credentials"
└─ Code: [old implementation]

CODE MODIFICATION at lines 52-54:
└─ Adds error handling logic
└─ Code now spans lines 50-72

RESPLITTING PROCESS:
├─ Delete old connection (lines 50-65)
├─ Prepare snippet with:
│  ├─ New line range: 50-72
│  ├─ Old description: "Validates user credentials"
│  └─ New code: [modified implementation]
└─ Submit to Phase 4 (BAML analysis)
    └─ BAML re-analyzes and provides:
       ├─ Updated description
       ├─ New connection boundaries if split
       └─ Stores in database
```

## Data Structures

### Connection Structure (from database)
```python
{
    "id": int,                    # Unique connection ID
    "direction": "incoming|outgoing",
    "start_line": int,
    "end_line": int,
    "code_snippet": str,
    "description": str,
    "needs_db_update": bool,      # Flag for database update
    "needs_code_update": bool,    # Flag if code snippet changed
    "is_deleted": bool,           # Flag for deletion
    "needs_resplitting": bool,    # Flag for Phase 4 re-analysis
    "old_description": str        # Previous description for context
}
```

### Snippet Info (for Phase 4 batching)
```python
{
    "file_path": str,
    "start_line": int,
    "end_line": int,
    "line_count": int,            # For batch calculation
    "description": str            # Old description for context (if resplitting)
}
```

### Diff Data from Line Parsing
```python
{
    "line_mapping": dict,         # old_line → new_line | None
    "added": list,                # New line numbers
    "removed": list,              # Deleted line numbers
    "replaced_ranges": list       # [(old_start, old_end, new_start, new_end), ...]
}
```

## Error Handling

### Strategy: Fail-Safe with Persistence

1. **Checkpoint Preservation**: Failed runs don't clear checkpoints
   - Only processed checkpoint IDs are deleted on success
   - Failed runs leave data for retry

2. **Database Rollback**: Transaction rollback on error
   ```python
   try:
       # Database operations
   except Exception:
       self.connection.connection.rollback()
       raise
   ```

3. **Logging**: Comprehensive debug logging
   - Line-by-line connection updates tracked
   - Diff analysis details logged
   - Phase 4 execution logged

4. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Missing files logged but don't stop processing
   - Missing connections don't block entire project
   - Failed Phase 4 batches logged but continue

---

## Performance Considerations

### 1. **Batch Size Configuration**
```python
CROSS_INDEXING_CONFIG["phase4_max_lines_per_batch"]
```
- Default: Configurable (typically 5000-10000 lines)
- Larger batches: Fewer Phase 4 calls but more LLM tokens
- Smaller batches: More calls but lower cost per call

### 2. **Line Mapping Efficiency**
- Uses `difflib.SequenceMatcher` (Python standard library)
- Linear time complexity O(n) for diff analysis
- Minimal memory overhead

### 3. **Database Optimization**
- Batch commits instead of individual commits
- Selective checkpoint deletion (not all-or-nothing)
- Indexed queries on file_id and connection_id

### 4. **Scaling for Large Projects**
- Files split into chunks if > max_lines
- Batching prevents overwhelming Phase 4 (BAML analysis)
- Supports multiple projects in single run

### 5. **Memory Management**
- Lazy initialization of components
- Code snippets cleared after Phase 4 batch processed
- No loading of entire project into memory

## Summary Workflow

### Successful Run:
```
1. Load checkpoint from DB
2. Create normalized diff
3. Display summary to user
4. For each project:
   a. Process modified files (update connections)
   b. Process new files (collect for Phase 4)
   c. Run Phase 4 in batches (analyze code)
5. Run Phase 5 (match connections across projects)
6. Delete processed checkpoints from DB
7. Report success
```

### On Error:
```
1. Catch exception
2. Rollback any in-flight database transaction
3. Log error details
4. Leave checkpoint data untouched (for retry)
5. Report failure to user
```

## Conclusion

The `CrossProjectIndexer` implements a sophisticated incremental indexing system that:
- ✅ Tracks changes between runs via checkpoints
- ✅ Intelligently updates affected connections
- ✅ Detects when connections need re-analysis (resplitting)
- ✅ Processes large codebases efficiently via batching
- ✅ Maintains database consistency with proper transaction handling
- ✅ Provides comprehensive logging for debugging

This enables efficient, scalable cross-project indexing for large codebases without re-processing unchanged code.
